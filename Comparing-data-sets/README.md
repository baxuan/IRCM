IRC Measurement - Comparing data sets
These pieces of codes are for researchers to use to collect bibliographic information from MAG and ACM data sets, and to calculate the bilateral scientific relationships between countries. The motivations and technical details of the development of these codes can be read in detail in:
- Nguyen et al, (2019) Enriching Bibliographic Data by Combining String Matching and the Wikidata Knowledge Graph to Improve the Measurement of International Research Collaboration. ISIS 2019: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics; and
- Nguyen et al, (2019) Exploring the Effects of Data Set Choice on Measuring International Research Collaboration: an Example Using the ACM Digital Library and Microsoft Academic Graph. ISIS 2019: Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics
They were created by Ba Xuan Nguyen, Jesse David Dinneen and Markus Luczak-Roesch (Victoria University of Wellington).
